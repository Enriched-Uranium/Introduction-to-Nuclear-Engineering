\section{Nuclear Engineering}

\subsection{Introduction}

Nuclear engineering is an endeavor that makes use of radiation and radioactive material for the benefit of mankind. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $E=mc^2$\quad {\itshape Einstein}, theoretical basis
    \item Chicago Pile 1\quad {\itshape Fermi}, the first nuclear reactor
    \item EBR-I\quad {\itshape USA}, the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity
    \item Obninsk\quad {\itshape USSR}, The first nuclear reactor for commercial power generation
    \item Shipping Port\quad {\itshape USA}, The first large-scale nuclear power plant
    \item Three-Mile-Island\quad {\itshape USA}, Level-5
    \item Chernobyl\quad {\itshape USSR}, Level-7
    \item Fukushima\quad {\itshape Japan}, Level-7
\end{itemize}

Chinese percentage of electricity from nuclear power is 5.02\% in 2021.

Nuclear energy is a thousand-year energy resource.

\subsection{Nuclear Reactor}

A nuclear reactor is an engineering device, in which nuclear fuel and structural materials are arranged such that a self-sustained fission chain reaction can occur in a controlled manner.

The nuclear energy (in the form of kinetic energy of fission fragments, neutrons and gamma rays) released during chain reaction is to be utilized.

In a reactor, neutrons are produced by fission and lost through capture and leakage.

Usually, we remove the heat generated in the reactor core through
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Heat conduction
    \item Heat convection
    \item Heat radiation(Negligible)
\end{enumerate}
